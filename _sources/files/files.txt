Reading and Writing files
=========================

In this workshop we will learn how to get data in and out of Python using
solely built-in Python functions and types, and we will then move on to see how
we can use modules such as `asciitable
<https://github.com/taldcroft/asciitable>`_ and `ATpy
<http://atpy.github.com>`_ to read tables of data in various formats.  
But before getting to file I/O we'll start filling in your basic Python
knowledge with a primer on Python data types.

Pure Python primer
