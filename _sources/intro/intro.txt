Practical Python for Astronomers is  a series of hands-on workshops to explore
the Python language and the powerful analysis tools it provides. *The emphasis
is on using Python to solve real-world problems that
astronomers are likely to encounter in research.*

- The workshops will immediately make use of the full suite of plotting,
  analysis, and file reading tools.
- Along the way elements of the Python language such as control structures,
  functions, and objects will be introduced as needed.
- This will be a hands-on experience largely focused on interactive data analysis
  using tutorial examples that you type or cut-n-paste into the Python
  interpreter.
- Participants should bring a laptop to each session or partner-up with someone who 
  has a laptop.

**Agenda**

The purpose of the talk today is to motivate astronomers to learn Python and start
using it as a tool for research and analysis.
