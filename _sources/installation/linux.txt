Linux
=====

All the necessary packages should be able to be installed using your
Linux package manager:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   Linux package manager installation instructions <linux_package_manager>


If the above method doesn't work for some reason, another option is to
use the Free Enthought Python Distribution (EPDFree).  `Enthought
<http://www.enthought.com>`_ sponsors much of the development for
`NumPy`_ and `SciPy`_. EPDFree is a bundled binary distribution of
Python including a set of useful packages.
