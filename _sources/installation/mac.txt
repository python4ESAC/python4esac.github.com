MacOS
=====

The recommended way to install all the necessary packages is by using
Macports.

Be aware that it can take around an hour to install everything using
Macports, as all the packages are compiled from source.

An alternative is to use the Free Enthought Python Distribution
(EPDFree).  `Enthought <http://www.enthought.com>`_ sponsors much of
the development for `NumPy`_ and `SciPy`_. EPDFree is a bundled binary
distribution of Python including a set of useful packages that is
quick to install. However, there is no version for 64-bit machines,
which means you'll be missing out on some performance improvements if
you have a 64-bit machine.
