NumPy
-----

.. contents::


`NumPy`_ is at the core of nearly every scientific Python application or
module since it provides a fast N-d array datatype that can be manipulated in a
vectorized form.  This will be familiar to users of IDL or Matlab.

NumPy has a good and systematic `basic tutorial
<http://www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial>`_ available.  It is highly
recommended that you read this tutorial to fill in the gaps left by this
workshop, but on its own it's a bit dry for the impatient astronomer.

Here we'll learn NumPy by performing a very simple reduction of a
2-dimensional long slit spectrum (3C120 from HST/STIS):

- Read in the 2-d image
- Plot the spatial profile and raw spectrum
- Filter cosmic rays from the background
- Fit for the background and subtract
- Sum the source signal

.. admonition:: INFO

    Python's ease-of-use often comes at a price: speed. Let's try to compute the
    sine of 20 million (uniform) random floats using Python's standard modules, and
    time it.
        

    ::

        import time # get access to CPU time
        import math # standard module implementing mathematical operators
        import random # generate random numbers
            
        t0 = time.time()    
        output = []
        for i in range(20000000):
            output.append(math.sin(random.random()))
        print time.time()-t0

    This needs **13.3424** seconds (on a Dell Dual Core Genuine Intel(R), T2600, 2.16GHz, 32-bit processor) of execution time. We can gain ~50% with some
    tricks (list comprehension, generator and local variables):

    ::

        sin,rand = math.sin,random.random
        output = [sin(rand()) for i in xrange(20000000)] # in Python 3, replace xrange with range

    Which tops at **8.6610** seconds. With numpy, we can gain another 50%, **and**
    have a much cleaner implementation:

    ::

        output = np.sin(np.random.uniform(size=20000000))

    The latter takes **3.9020** seconds to run. A pure FORTRAN program is, however,
    still almost 50% faster than numpy (2.2641 seconds).

    Basically, numpy provides vectorized functions written in C or FORTRAN that
    can act on pure Python objects, with a little bit of function-call overhead.
    Most of the looping is done in C or FORTRAN, avoiding the expensive ``for``
    loops in pure Python.

    Sometimes doing things in a vectorized way is not possible or just too
    confusing.  There is an art here and the basic answer is that if it runs
    fast enough then you are good to go.  Otherwise things need to be vectorized
    or maybe coded in C or Fortran.

Setup
^^^^^^^^

Before going further you need to get the example data and script files for
the workshop.  Now that you have a working Python installation we can do this
without worrying about details of the platform (e.g. linux has wget,
Mac has curl, Windows might not have tar, etc etc).

Now start IPython (``ipython --pylab``) or use your existing session and enter:

.. sourcecode:: python

<<<<<<< HEAD
    import urllib2, tarfile
    url = 'http://python4astronomers.github.com/core/core_examples.tar'
    tarfile.open(fileobj=urllib2.urlopen(url), mode='r|').extractall()
    cd py4ast/core
    ls
=======
  In [1]: import urllib2, tarfile, os
  
  In [1]: url = 'http://python4astronomers.github.com/core/core_examples.tar'
  
  In [1]: tarfile.open(fileobj=urllib2.urlopen(url), mode='r|').extractall()
  
  In [1]: cd py4ast/core
  
  In [1]: ls
>>>>>>> 4d376b64af6a2459d9986f4b3d4f75d6fb2b2c9f


Leave this IPython session open for the rest of the workshop.

.. admonition:: Exercise (for the interested reader): How did that code above work?

   Explain what's happening in each part of the previous code snippet to grab
   the file at a URL and untar it.  Google on "python urllib2" and "python
   tarfile" to find the relevant module docs.  Figure out how you would
   use the ``tarfile`` module to create a tarfile.

.. raw:: html

   <p class="flip1">Click to Show/Hide Solution</p> <div class="panel1">

- ``urllib2.urlopen(url)`` opens the URL as a streaming file-like object
- ``mode='r|' means ``tarfile`` is expecting a streaming file-like object
  with no ability to seek in the file
- ``tarfile.open(..).extractall`` then extracts the tar archive

Creating a tarfile is left for the reader to solve.

Read in the 2-d image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First read in the long-slit spectrum data.  The standard file format available
for download from `MAST <http://archive.stsci.edu/hst/>`_ is a FITS file with
three identically sized images providing the 2-d spectral intensity, error
values, and data quality for each pixel.  The slit direction is along the rows
(up and down) and wavelength is in columns (left to right).

.. sourcecode:: python

  import pyfits
  hdus = pyfits.open('3c120_stis.fits.gz')
  hdus

Type ``?hdus`` to get a little more detail on the ``hdus`` object.

Now give meaningful names to each of the three images that are available in the
FITS HDU list.  You can access element ``n`` in a list with the index ``[n]``,
where the count starts from 0:

.. sourcecode:: python

  primary = hdus[0].data  # Primary (NULL) header data unit
  img = hdus[1].data      # Intensity data
  err = hdus[2].data      # Error per pixel
  dq = hdus[3].data       # Data quality per pixel

.. raw:: html

   <p class="flip2">Click to Show/Hide Tip: pyFITS </p> <div class="panel2">

.. admonition:: TIP: pyFITS

    The HDUList from a FITS file acts like an ordered dictionary: instead of accessing
    via an index ``n``, you can also access the extensions by *name*:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        img = hdus['SCI'].data      # Intensity data
        err = hdus['ERR'].data      # Error per pixel
        dq = hdus['DQ'].data       # Data quality per pixel

    You can find (and set) the name of an extension throught the header keyword
    ``EXTNAME`` (case-insensitive).

    .. sourcecode:: python
    
        hdus[1].header['extname']
 
    A frequently used convention is to store scientific data in an extension named
    ``SCI``. For more information on FITS files and pyFITS, see the `pyFITS documentation <http://stsdas.stsci.edu/download/wikidocs/The_PyFITS_Handbook.pdf>`_
    
.. raw:: html

   </div>


Next have a look at the images using one of the standard Matplotlib plotting
functions:

.. sourcecode:: python

  import pylab as plt # not needed when you run ipython with the pylab option
  import numpy as np  # not needed when you run ipython with the pylab option
  plt.imshow(img)

.. raw:: html

   <p class="flip4">Click to Show/Hide Tip: matplotlib widget</p> <div class="panel4">

.. admonition:: TIP: matplotlib widget

    The matplotlib widget that appears when you make a plot in IPython (or whenever
    you call ``plt.show()`` in a script), is highly interactive. You can:
    
    * *zoom in* by clicking on the *zoom* icon and dragging a rectangle
    * *pan* by clicking on the *pan* icon and dragging the image around
    * *pan* and *zoom* by clicking on the *pan* icon, click, hold and drag with the right mouse button.
    
.. raw:: html

   </div>

As you can see, it is hard to see things. So, let's set a few option for this
plot. First, we want the origin in the lower left instead of the upper left
corner:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    plt.clf()
    plt.imshow(img, origin = 'lower')
    
Second, let's change the scaling to something more sensible. By default,
``plt.imshow()`` scales the colorbar from the minimum to the maximum value. In
our case that is not the best option. We can set a lower and upper bound and
add a colorbar to our plot:

.. sourcecode:: python

    plt.clf()
    plt.imshow(img, origin = 'lower', vmin = -10, vmax = 65)
    plt.colorbar()

Your plot should not look like this (it is possible that the colormap differs,
if your matplotlib has different defaults set).

.. image:: imgview_img.png
  :scale: 50

.. admonition:: Exercise: View the error and data quality images

  Bring up a viewer window for the other two images.  Play with the toolbar
  buttons on the lower-left (hint: try the four on the right first, then
  imagine a web browser for the three on the left).  Does the save button
  work for you?

.. raw:: html

   <p class="flip5">Click to Show/Hide Solution</p> <div class="panel5">

::
  
  # Errors
  plt.clf()
  plt.imshow(err, origin = 'lower', vmin = 5, vmax = 25)
  plt.colorbar()
  # Data quality
  plt.clf()
  plt.imshow(dq, origin = 'lower', vmax = 25)
  plt.colorbar()

.. image:: imgview_err.png
   :scale: 50

.. image:: imgview_dq.png
   :scale: 50

.. raw:: html

   </div>

Now discover a little bit about the images you have read in, first with ``?``::

  img?

Next use ``help`` and note the slightly different information that you get::

  help(img)

Use tab completion to see all the methods in short form::

  img.<TAB>

Finally find the shape of the image and its minimum value:

.. sourcecode:: python

  img.shape  # Get the shape of img
  img.min()  # Call object method min with no arguments


NumPy basics
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before going further on the spectral extraction project we need to learn about
a few key features of NumPy.

Making arrays
#############

Arrays can be created in different ways:

.. sourcecode:: python

  a = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])   # create an array from a list of values
  a
  b = np.arange(4)                 # create an array of 4 integers, from 0 to 3  
  b
  np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 5)      # create an array of 5 evenly spaced samples from -pi to pi
  np.logspace(1,3,9) # create a log-spaced array of 9 floats between (and including) 10 and 1000

The function ``arange`` is better only used when working with integer arguments.

.. raw:: html

   <p class="flip6">Click to Show/Hide Tip: creating sequences of numbers </p> <div class="panel6">

.. admonition:: TIP: creating sequences of numbers

    A general interface for creating arrays in provided by ``np.mgrid``. The syntax
    is slightly different than before, because it uses index slices instead of arguments.

    .. sourcecode:: python

        np.mgrid[0:5:1]
        np.mgrid[0:5:10j]

    And in more dimensions:

    .. sourcecode:: python

      x,y = np.mgrid[-1:3:5j,0:2:0.5]
      x
      y

    
.. raw:: html

   </div>
  
New arrays can be obtained by operating with existing arrays:

.. sourcecode:: python

  a + b**2            # elementwise operations


Arrays may have more than one dimension:

.. sourcecode:: python

  f = np.ones([3, 4])                 # 3 x 4 float array of ones  
  f
  g = np.zeros([2, 3, 4], dtype=int)  # 3 x 4 x 5 int array of zeros  
  g
  i = np.zeros_like(f)                # array of zeros with same shape/type as f


You can change the dimensions of existing arrays:

.. sourcecode:: python

  w = np.arange(12)
  w.shape = [3, 4]       # does not modify the total number of elements
  w
  x = np.arange(5)  
  x 
  y = x.reshape(5, 1)  
  y = x.reshape(-1, 1)  # Same thing but NumPy figures out correct length
  y
  
It is possible to operate with arrays of different dimensions as long as they fit well (broadcasting):

.. sourcecode:: python

  x + y * 10

.. warning::
    
    Lists and array behave fundamentally different!

    .. sourcecode:: python
    
      mylist = [1,2,3]      
      myarray = np.array([1,2,3])      
      mylist*2      
      myarray*2
  
.. admonition:: Exercise: Make a ripple

  Calculate a surface ``z = cos(r) / (r + 5)`` where ``r = sqrt(x**2 +
  y**2)``.  Set ``x`` to an array that goes from -20 to 20 stepping by 0.25
  Make ``y`` the same as ``x`` but "transposed" using the ``reshape`` trick above.
  Use `plt.imshow` to display the image of ``z``.

Array access and slicing
############################

NumPy provides powerful methods for accessing array elements or particular subsets of an array,
e.g. the 4th column or every other row.  This is called slicing.  The outputs
below illustrate basic slicing, but you don't need to type these examples:

.. sourcecode:: python

   a = np.arange(20).reshape(4,5)   
   a   
   a[2, 3]   # select element in row 2, col 3 (counting from 0)
   a[2, :]   # select every element in row 2   
   a[:, 0]   # select every element in col 0
   a[0:3, 1:3]

As a first practical
example plot column 300 of the longslit image to look at the spatial profile:

.. sourcecode:: python

  plt.figure()             # make a new figure -- by default matplotlib overplots.  
  plt.plot(img[:, 300])

Note that as long as you don't close existing figures, they will be kept in memory.
If you want to close the current figure, call ``plt.close()``. If you want to
close all figures call ``plt.close('all')``.

.. image:: img_col300.png
  :scale: 50

The full slicing syntax also allows for a step size::

  <slice> = i0:i1:step
  array[<slice0>, <slice1>, ...]

- ``i0`` is the first index value (default is zero if not provided)
- ``i1`` is the index upper bound (default is last element index + 1)
- ``step`` is the step size (default is one).  When ``step`` is not specified then the final ":" is not required.

.. admonition:: Exercise: Slice the error array

  - For row 254 of the error array ``err`` plot columns 10 to 200 stepping by 3.
  - Print a rectangular region slice of the data quality with rows 251 to 253 (inclusive) and columns 101 to
    104 (inclusive).  What did you learn about the index upper bound value?

.. raw:: html

   <p class="flip8">Click to Show/Hide Solution</p> <div class="panel8">

.. sourcecode:: python

  plt.clf()
  plt.plot(err[254, 10:200:3])
  dq[251:254, 101:105]

The index upper bound ``i1`` is one more than the final index that gets
included in the slice.  In other words the slice includes everything up to,
*but not including*, the index upper bound ``i1``.  There are good reasons for
this, but for now just accept and learn it.

Plot the spatial profile and raw spectrum
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Plot the spatial profile by summing along the wavelength direction:

.. sourcecode:: python

  profile = img.sum(axis=1)
  plt.figure()
  plt.plot(profile)

Now plot the spectrum by summing along the spatial direction:

.. sourcecode:: python

  spectrum = img.sum(axis=0) 
  plt.figure()  
  plt.plot(spectrum)

Since most of the sum is in the background region there is a lot of noise and
cosmic-ray contamination.

   :scale: 50

   :scale: 50

.. admonition:: Exercise: Use slicing to make a better spectrum plot

  Use slicing to do the spectrum sum using only the rows in the image where
  there is a signal from the source.
  Hint: zoom into the profile plot to find the right row range.

.. Solution


Filter cosmic rays from the background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Plot five columns (wavelength) from the spectrum image as follows:

.. sourcecode:: python

  plt.clf()
  plt.plot(img[:, 254:259])

.. image:: img_row254_noisy.png
   :scale: 50

The basic idea in spectral extraction is to subtract out the background and sum
over rows with the source signal.

It's evident that there are significant cosmic ray defects in the data.  In
order to do a good job of subtracting the background we need to filter them
out.  Doing this correctly in general is difficult and in reality one would
just use the answers already provided by STSci.

**Strategy**: Use a median filter to smooth out single-pixel deviations.  Then
use sigma-clipping to remove large variations between the actual and smoothed
image.

.. sourcecode:: python

  import scipy.signal
  img_sm = scipy.signal.medfilt(img, 5)
  sigma = np.median(err)
  bad = np.abs(img - img_sm) / sigma > 8.0
  img_cr = img.copy()
  img_cr[bad] = img_sm[bad]
  img_cr[230:280,:] = img[230:280,:]  # Filter only for background

Check if it worked:

.. sourcecode:: python

  plt.clf()
  plt.plot(img_cr[:, 254:259])

.. image:: img_row254_clean.png
   :scale: 50

This introduces the important concept of slicing with a **boolean mask**.  Let's
look at a smaller example:

.. sourcecode:: python

   a = np.array([1, 4, -2, 4, -5])   
   neg = (a < 0)    # Parentheses here for clarity but are not required
   neg
   a[neg] = 0   
   a

A slightly more complex example shows that this works the same on N-d arrays
and that you can compose logical expressions:

.. sourcecode:: python

   a = np.arange(25).reshape(5,5)
   ok = (a > 6) & (a < 17)     # "ok = a > 6 & a < 17" will FAIL!
   a[~ok] = 0                  # Note the "logical not" operator
   a
   
.. admonition:: Exercise [intermediate]: circular region slicing

   Remember the surface ``z = cos(r) / (r + 5)`` that you made previously.  Set
   ``z = 0`` for every pixel of ``z`` that is within 10 units of (x,y) = (10, 15).

.. raw:: html

   <p class="flip10">Click to Show/Hide Solution</p> <div class="panel10">

.. sourcecode:: python

  dist = np.sqrt((x-10)**2 + (y-15)**2)  
  mask = dist < 10  
  z[mask] = 0  
  plt.imshow(z, origin = 'lower')

.. image:: ripple_masked.png
   :scale: 50

.. raw:: html

   </div>

.. admonition:: Detour: copy versus reference

   **Question**
     In the median filtering commands above we wrote ``img_cr = img.copy()``.  Why
     was that needed instead of just ``img_cr = img``?

   **Answer**
     Because the statement ``img_cr = img`` would just create another reference
     pointing to the underlying N-d array object that ``img`` references.

   Variable names in Python are just pointers to the actual Python
   object.  To see this clearly do the following:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        a = np.arange(8)     
        b = a     
        id(a)     # Unique identifier for the object referred to by "a": arange(8)     
        id(b)     # Unique identifier for the object referred to by "b": same ^^     
        b[3] = -10     
        a

   After getting over the initial confusion this behavior is actually a good
   thing because it is efficient and consistent within Python.  If you really
   need a copy of an array then use the copy() method as shown.

   **BEWARE** of one common pitfall: NumPy "basic" slicing like ``a[3:6]``
   does NOT make a copy:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        b = a[3:6]     
        b
        b[1] = 100     
        a

   However if you do arithmetic or boolean mask then a copy is always made:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        a = np.arange(4)     
        b = a**2     
        a[1] = 100     
        a
        b    # Still as expected after changing "a"

Fit the background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To subtract the background signal from the source region we want to fit a
quadratic to the background pixels and subtract that quadratic from the entire
image which includes the source region.

Let's tackle a simpler problem first and fit the background for a single column:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    x = np.append(np.arange(10, 200), np.arange(300, 480))  # Background rows    
    y = img_cr[x, 10]         # Background rows of column 10 of cleaned image    
    plt.figure()    
    plt.plot(x, y)  
    pfit = np.polyfit(x, y, 2)   # Fit a 2nd order polynomial to (x, y) data    
    yfit = np.polyval(pfit, x)   # Evaluate the polynomial at x   
    plt.plot(x, yfit)   
    plt.grid()

.. image:: bkg_fit0.png
   :scale: 50

Now do this for every column and store the results in a background image:

.. sourcecode:: python

  xrows = np.arange(img_cr.shape[0])          # Array from 0 .. N_rows-1
  bkg = np.zeros_like(img_cr)                 # Empty image for background fits
  for col in np.arange(img_cr.shape[1]):      # Iterate over columns
      pfit = np.polyfit(x, img_cr[x, col], 2) # Fit poly over bkg rows for col
      bkg[:, col] = np.polyval(pfit, xrows)   # Eval poly at ALL row positions
  
  plt.clf()
  plt.imshow(bkg, origin = 'lower', vmin=0, vmax=20)
  plt.colorbar()

.. image:: bkg_fit1.png
   :scale: 50

Finally subtract this background and see if it worked:

.. sourcecode:: python

  img_bkg = img_cr - bkg  
  plt.clf()  
  plt.imshow(img_bkg, origin = 'lower', vmin=0, vmax=60)  
  plt.colorbar()

.. Solution
   badimg = np.zeros(bad.shape)
   badimg[bad] = 1
   ImgView(badimg)

Sum the source signal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now the final step is easy and is left as an exercise.

.. admonition:: Exercise: Make the final spectrum

   Sum the rows of the background subtracted spectrum and plot.  Hint: you
   already did it once in a previous exercise.

**To do**: flux calibration and wavelength calibration!

SciPy
^^^^^

It is impossible to do justice to the full contents of the `SciPy`_ package: is
entirely too large!  What is left as homework for the reader is to
click through to the main `SciPy Reference Manual
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/>`_ and skim the `tutorial
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/index.html>`_.  Keep
this repository of functionality in mind whenever you need some numerical
functionality that isn't in NumPy: there is a good chance it is in SciPy:

- Basic functions in Numpy (and top-level scipy)
- Special functions (scipy.special)
- Integration (scipy.integrate)
- Optimization (optimize)
- Interpolation (scipy.interpolate)
- Fourier Transforms (scipy.fftpack)
- Signal Processing (signal)
- Linear Algebra
- Statistics
- Multi-dimensional image processing (ndimage)
- File IO (scipy.io)
- Weave
