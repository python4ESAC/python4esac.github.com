ATpy
====


The core library modules and the virtual observatory tools we have looked 
so far represent some of the lower level tools that you can reuse in your
own software and coding.  Yet all of them beg for higher level wrappers
that tie directly into more powerful Scientific / Astronomical python modules.

`atpy`_ contains two such tools:  
`atpy.irsa_service <http://atpy.github.com/format_online.html#virtual-observatory>`_ 
and 
`atpy.vo_conesearch <http://atpy.github.com/format_online.html#irsa-query>`_

Putting it All Together
-----------------------

Tom Robitialle created a pair of screencast demonstrations showing how
`ATpy`_, `APLpy`_ combined with these powerful online astronomy tools come
together in research and figure creation. Its sometime easier to just sit
and listen.

* `APLpy + ATpy Online Query <http://www.youtube.com/astropython#p/a/u/1/4OxKKbLJ_Zk>`_ (YouTube)


.. admonition::  Exercise: Repeat the APLpy+ATpy demo 

    Except using FITS images downloaded from virtual observatory ``Siap`` 
    sites.
